# Track Me
This application was developed as part of the Opportunity Hack hackathon which was held in Galvanize, Phoenix on October 20-21.

Progress tracking application is a production-grade end to end application used to generically define, create and track the progress of users/volunteers which are mapped to corresponding event types. The application was aimed at NPOs like Will2Walk.

The application is based on following technologies: <br/>
Backend - `Java`,`Spring-boot`. <br/>
Frontend - `JavaScript`, `Angularjs`, `HTML5`, `Bootstrap`. <br/>
Database - `MongoDB`. <br/>
Reports - `D3.js`. <br/>

The modules can be created on the fly and the system allows you to add the data in two ways: form and csv.
## To run the application do the following: <br/>
1. Clone the repository.
2. You must have Maven and mongoDB installed on your system.
3. Go to app.java and run it as java application.
4. Go to localhost:8080 and you are good to go.
