# Track Me
This application was developed as part of the Opportunity Hack hackathon which was held in Galvanize, Phoenix on October 20-21.

Progress tracking application is a production-grade end to end application used to generically define, create and track the progress of users/volunteers which are mapped to corresponding event types. The application was aimed at NPOs like Will2Walk.

The application is based on following technologies:
Backend - `Java`,`Spring-boot`.
Frontend - `JavaScript`, `Angularjs`, `HTML5`, `Bootstrap`.
Database - `MongoDB`.
Reports - `D3.js`.
